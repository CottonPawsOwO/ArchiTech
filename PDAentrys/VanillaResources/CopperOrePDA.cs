                      "Copper Ore is found predominantly within limestone outcrops scattered across the seabed, particularly in shallow biomes. Its conductive properties make it essential for developing electronic devices.\n\n" +
                      "2. Chemical Composition:\n" +
                      "Composed primarily of copper carbonate and copper sulfate, the ore exhibits high ductility and malleability. Traces of native copper often form metallic veins visible within the stone.\n\n" +

                      "This adaptable ore has managed to thrive on the planet, forming extensive colonies due to its minimal impact on the environment. It plays a critical role in underwater ecosystems, functioning as both producer and consumer within its niche.\n\n" +
